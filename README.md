EXP 5: COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PROMPTING PATTERNS ACROSS DIFFERENT AI MODELS
Aim
To examine how various AI systems (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Meta AI) perform when given
unstructured (naïve) versus structured (basic) prompts across diverse tasks. The goal is to evaluate
their responses in terms of clarity, correctness, and level of detail.
AI Tools Used
• ChatGPT (OpenAI)
• Gemini (Google DeepMind)
• Meta AI (Meta Platforms, LLaMA models)
Concept
• Naïve Prompt → A loosely framed query without much direction.
• Basic Prompt → A well-defined and specific query that guides the AI with clearer context.
Each model was tested with both prompt types across different use-cases like storytelling, factual
Q&A, summarization, coding, translation, and role-play.

Evaluation
• Quality: How well the answer is structured and readable.
• Accuracy: How factually correct the answer is.
• Depth: How detailed and comprehensive the response is.
Key Observations
1. 2. 3. 4. ChatGPT excels in depth and clarity, especially when prompts are specific.
Gemini is best for concise, fact-driven answers and benefits from Google integration.
Meta AI provides a more casual, user-friendly interaction, but sacrifices detail.
Structured prompts significantly improved the performance of all three AIs.
Result
The comparative study was carried out successfully. It was found that ChatGPT is strongest for in-
depth responses, Gemini for concise accuracy, and Meta AI for social-style interactions. Prompt
refinement consistently enhanced the quality of outputs, proving the value of clear instructions.
